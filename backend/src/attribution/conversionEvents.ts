 * -- this is the entire point of the request (there's no discovery/reply
 * work happening alongside it to protect), so the caller (api/ingest.ts)
 * should see the failure and return a 500 rather than silently losing the
 * event.
 *
 * Idempotent by (source, externalEventId): a retried webhook delivery or
 * a re-run of FillbookHQ's sync cron after a partial failure re-sends the
 * same externalEventId, and the unique index from migration 0035 makes a
 * duplicate a no-op rather than a double-counted conversion. Detected via
 * Postgres's own unique_violation code (23505) rather than a
 * select-then-insert race, which two concurrent deliveries of the same
 * event could both pass.
