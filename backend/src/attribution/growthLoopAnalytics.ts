/**
 * "Published content -> customer outcomes" growth loop (2026-09-18),
 * Analytics item 4: pure aggregation over already-fetched rows, kept
 * separate from summary.ts's Supabase queries the same way
 * dailyXFeedPost.ts's computeTodayXPostView is -- easy to unit test
 * without a database, and the honesty rules below (what counts as
 * "unavailable" vs "zero") live in exactly one place.
 *
 * What this can and cannot honestly claim, given what Growth OS actually
 * has access to (see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's isolation goal -- no DB
 * access into FillbookHQ):
 *  - "Published content" = content_publications rows with a real
 *    owner-confirmed publication (ownerReportedPublishedAt set) --
 *    see migration 0035's own comment on why row-existence alone isn't
 *    enough (a placeholder row can exist purely to hold a destination
 *    link before anything is published).
 *  - "Attributable visits" = link_clicks, NOT total site traffic --
 *    Growth OS has no visibility into visits that never went through one
 *    of its own tracked links. Labeled explicitly, never called
 *    "visitors."
 *  - "Signups"/"activated"/"first paid" = conversion_events by
 *    event_type, delivered by FillbookHQ's own sync (see fillbook's
 *    growthOsSync.ts). Zero here can mean either "really zero" or
 *    "FillbookHQ's sync hasn't run yet" -- see hasAnyFunnelData below,
 *    which the caller uses to distinguish those two cases explicitly
 *    rather than presenting a bare 0.
 *  - "Current active subscriptions" is NOT computed here at all --
 *    billing state lives in FillbookHQ's own database and is
 *    structurally unavailable to this isolated project. Never
 *    approximated from first_paid conversion counts, which only ever
 *    grow and say nothing about churn.
 *  - "Cost" here is content-production cost (cost_events -- LLM/API
 *    spend), never "ad spend" (this project runs organic-only, no paid
 *    placement exists to spend on).
