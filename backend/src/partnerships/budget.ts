 * reserved for pitch generation/review -- the actual product-value work.
 * Both are enforced ATOMICALLY alongside the shared cap by

 * a request must clear its own bucket's remaining allowance AND the shared
 * cap, computed from real month-to-date spend plus any other in-flight
 * reservation, before it's allowed to proceed. These two deliberately don't
 * need to sum to exactly PARTNERSHIP_MONTHLY_BUDGET_USD to stay correct --
