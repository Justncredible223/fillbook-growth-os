 * Mention budget for cold replies. The 2026-09-25 showcase direction (fillbookShowcase.ts) makes the Fillbook
 * sentence "the point of the reply" whenever a view fits, and nothing limited how often that happened: the share of
 * posted cold replies naming Fillbook went from 0-9% a day (Sep 17-24) to 40-100% (Sep 25-30), several of them the
 * same pitch twice. A brand account that pitches in nearly every reply reads as spam and, with X already limiting the
 * account's replies, risks more suppression.
 *
 * The showcase rule is unchanged for the replies that do get a Fillbook sentence. This only decides, from what was
 * actually posted recently, whether the next draft is allowed one: once more than MAX_MENTION_SHARE of the last
 * MENTION_WINDOW posted replies named Fillbook, the next draft must leave it out, same mechanism as recovery mode.
