 * "Search skipped -- this month's Prospecting budget is used up." It was
 * $9.00 before that (and $8.00 when Phase 20 first landed it; see
 * docs/PROGRESS_LEDGER.md).
 *
 * What it measures: getProspectingMonthSpendUsd (backend/src/cost/
 * costTracking.ts) sums real recorded `cost_events` rows -- not estimates --
 * for event types "x_search_read" (prospecting's X searches) and
 * "prospecting_llm_call" (the reply writer), over the current UTC calendar
 * month. So the window resets on the 1st at 00:00 UTC, and the gate trips
 * once that sum reaches this number.
 *
 * Rate math: X search reads bill at the general $0.005/read tier (not the
 * cheap $0.001 Owned Reads tier mentions use). $15.00 / $0.005 = 3,000
 * search reads/month if nothing else drew on the budget. Today's config --
 * TOPICS_PER_SEARCH_RUN=2 * RESULTS_PER_QUERY=10 * 3 runs/day = 60 reads/day
 * = $0.30/day = ~$9.00/month -- is the search-only ceiling; the reply-writer
 * LLM calls counted under the same gate are what push real spend past it.
 *
 * IMPORTANT -- this cap no longer protects the X credit pool on its own.
 * $15 is HIGHER than the shared $10 X API credit pool documented in
 * docs/PROGRESS_LEDGER.md Phase 4 and docs/PROSPECTING.md, a pool also drawn
 * on by mentions/inbound ingestion and by Partnerships discovery. There is no
 * pool-level guard anywhere in the codebase: each feature caps only its own
 * bucket. What still keeps prospecting search inside the pool is the run rate
 * above (~$9.00/month search-only), not this ceiling.
