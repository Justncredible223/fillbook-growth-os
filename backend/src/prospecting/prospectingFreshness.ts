/**
 * Freshness policy for Prospecting's daily selection (2026-09-07 growth
 * review): opportunity_score is computed ONCE, at discovery time
 * (prospectingScoring.ts, called from prospectingSearch.ts), and stored as
 * a static column -- it is never recomputed. Because a candidate can sit
 * in backlog for days before it's ever selected (see
 * prospectingDailySelection.ts's DAILY_SET_MAX cap and
 * prospectingEligibility.ts's QUEUE_FULL_THRESHOLD, which together mean a
 * strong-but-old candidate keeps re-winning a daily slot every day it goes
 * unactioned), the daily selection was re-ranking on a number that
 * reflected how fresh the post was AT DISCOVERY, not how fresh it actually
 * is today -- a real, confirmed production issue: candidates commonly
 * surfaced to the owner 2-4 days old.
 *
 * This module is the fix, applied only at SELECTION time (never at
 * discovery, and never by mutating the stored opportunity_score column --
 * see prospectingDailySelection.ts for how these compose with the
 * existing score). Two independent policies:
 *
 * 1. recencyDecayMultiplier -- a soft penalty on the stored score based on
 *    CURRENT post age, so a candidate found fresh but left unactioned for
 *    days no longer keeps its original full recency credit forever.
 * 2. isEligibleForDailySelection -- a hard cutoff: a post older than
 *    MAX_AGE_FOR_DAILY_SELECTION_MS is never chosen for today's active
 *    reply set, regardless of score. No exception to this exists anywhere
 *    in fillbookhq/docs/social/MASTER_SOCIAL_STRATEGY.md or elsewhere in
 *    this codebase as of this change -- if one is ever added, it must be
 *    threaded through here explicitly and documented at the call site.
 *
 * Both treat a missing/unknown postCreatedAt as "not penalized, not
 * excluded" (multiplier 1.0, always eligible) -- there is no evidence to
 * penalize on, and an age gate should never punish missing data by
 * silently discarding an otherwise-good candidate.
 *
 * Neither function mutates anything or performs I/O -- both are pure and
 * take `now` explicitly so they're fully deterministic under test.

 * mathematically unreachable against MIN_DAILY_SET_SCORE (40) before that

 * decayed to the floor (45) still clears the 40-point bar -- i.e. "still
