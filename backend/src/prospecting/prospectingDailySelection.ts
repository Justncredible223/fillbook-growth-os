/**
 * Selects today's working set from an already-scored, already-clean
 * candidate pool (spam/promo already excluded upstream). Pure function --
 * no I/O, easy to test against real exported data.
 *
 * Rules, in order:
 * 1. Exclude anything older than the 72h freshness cutoff
 *    (prospectingFreshness.ts's isEligibleForDailySelection) -- never
 *    scored or compared, just set aside as tooOldForToday.
 * 2. Sort the rest by an EFFECTIVE score -- the stored (discovery-time)
 *    opportunity_score adjusted for how fresh the post actually is right
 *    now (prospectingFreshness.ts's effectiveScoreForSelection), not the
 *    frozen value alone. This is what closes a real, confirmed production
 *    issue: a candidate discovered fresh but left unactioned for days kept
 *    re-winning a daily slot on its original recency credit, so candidates
 *    commonly surfaced to the owner 2-4 days old. Ties broken by more
 *    recent discovery first, so a fresher post wins a tie over a stale one.
 * 3. Drop anything under MIN_DAILY_SET_SCORE (measured against the
 *    effective score) -- never force-fill weak or gone-stale posts just
 *    to hit a count.
 * 4. At most one candidate per author per day ("Avoid interacting
 *    repeatedly with the same account simply because search surfaced
 *    multiple posts. One strong interaction is better than looking
 *    automated.") -- keeps that author's highest-scored post, defers the
 *    rest.
 * 5. Cap at DAILY_SET_MAX. If fewer than DAILY_SET_MAX/DAILY_SET_MIN
 *    survive steps 1-4, that's a correct, expected result -- show fewer,
 *    not padding.
