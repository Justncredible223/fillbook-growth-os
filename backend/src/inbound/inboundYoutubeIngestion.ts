 * repository/classifier/status-machine so Inbound's queue, drafting, and
 * "mark responded" flow all work identically regardless of platform.
 *
 * Only top-level comments are fetched (see YoutubeCommentAdapter's own
 * doc comment) -- a reply-to-a-reply thread would need a second API call
 * per thread (comments.list?parentId=), not done in this first version.
 * `isDirectReplyToUs`/`isQuotePost` are therefore always false here; a
 * comment still gets a real priority from classifyPriority based on its
 * text and whether the commenter has engaged before.
 *
 * commentThreads.list has no since-id filter (see fetchTopLevelComments),
 * so "what's new" is computed client-side: comments arrive newest-first,
 * and this stops consuming the list as soon as it reaches the id stored
 * as this video's cursor from the previous run.
