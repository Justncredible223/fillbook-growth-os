/**
 * Discovery and generation are two entirely separate code paths
 * (discovery.ts / partnershipsHandlers.ts) that both spend against the
 * SAME shared Partnerships budget. The per-prospect generation_claimed_at
 * mutex (0023) only ever serialized generation against itself; nothing
 * previously stopped a discovery run and a generation attempt from each
 * reading a stale month-spend total at the same time. These tests prove
 * the atomic reservation (migration 0024) closes that gap too, not just
 * the same-feature case already covered elsewhere.
