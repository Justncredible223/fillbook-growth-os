/**
 * Regression coverage for a real, confirmed bug (2026-09-07): a topic's X
 * search query can find genuine candidates that ingestion happily accepts
 * as "new", only for prospectingHandlers.ts's listProspectingQueue() to
 * silently reclassify every one of them as 'not_relevant' the instant the
 * app fetches the queue -- because the query's own guaranteed phrase
 * never actually satisfies isPlausiblyTradingRelated()'s anchor list.
 * Confirmed live for "too_many_trades" (4 of 4 candidates from one real
 * run never reached the app) and "overtrading" (no anchor at all).
 *
 * For every topic whose query is unambiguous (a single quoted phrase,
 * optionally with one or more required bare words -- no OR/parentheses,
 * since only one branch of an OR is guaranteed present), this asserts
 * that the literal, minimal text X search guarantees a match on actually
 * passes the relevance gate. A topic added later that has this same gap
 * will fail this test immediately instead of silently starving the
 * Prospecting queue in production.
